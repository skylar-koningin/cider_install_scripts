# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We are on a Rolling-release-esque type of release model, so the newest version of our code will be the only supported version of our code

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a security flaw in our code (very unlikely) either create an issue in the Issues tab, or send me aDM on Discord at skylar_koningin
