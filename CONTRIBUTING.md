# Contributions to this Repository

If you would like to contribute to this repository, please do one of these two things:
1. (Mainly for people without a Github account) Write the code on your computer, then send me a DM on Discord at skylar_koningin
2. Create a local repository, code what you want, create a new branch when you push the commit, then submit a pull request
3. Create an issue in the issues tab and wait for me to code it

If you contribute, thank you so much for your help!
