# DISCLAIMER

This is not a free way to use Cider â€” you must already have a license to use it.

For Cider devs and legal: I am not sharing a way to use Cider for free and I recognize that Cider is owned by you wonderful people. I am making this mainly for myself because I like to distrohop and I want a quick way to install it. The only reason I'm uploading it to GitHub is because I feel that some people would also find it useful.
