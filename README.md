# DISCLAIMER

This is not a free way to use Cider â€” you must already have a license to use it.

For Cider devs and legal: I am not sharing a way to use Cider for free and I recognize that Cider is owned by you wonderful people. I am making this mainly for myself because I like to distrohop and I want a quick way to install it. The only reason I'm uploading it to GitHub is because I feel that some people would also find it useful.

# Current OS Support

- Windows (Tested on Windows 11)
- MacOS Intel (Tested on macOS Sequoia)
- MacOS Silicon (Untested, but same code as Intel version)

# How to Install and Use

## 0. Download the binaries from https://taproom.cider.sh

This step is required only for Windows and macOS users. Linux users using apt, dnf, zypper, or pacman can skip this step, but it's recommended for consistency.

- https://taproom.cider.sh

*Stated by Elijah (creator of Cider): "We generally don't recommend re-distributing Cider binaries on GitHub, as Cider is a paid product this could lead to unintended interpretation if people don't read into it all the way ... people combing Google can easily skip this information if SEO decided to bump entries."* (I asked if I should remove the binaries, and he said that he would reccomend it until they had public ones)
Please don't send Elijah or Cider devs any hate, and I can completely understand their reasoning.

## 1. Install Git

- Windows: `winget install git`
- MacOS: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" && brew install git`
- apt: `sudo apt install git`
- dnf: `sudo dnf install git`
- zypper: `sudo zypper install git`
- pacman: `sudo pacman -S git`
- xbps: `sudo xbps-install git`
- nix: `nix-env -i git` (wont work if nix profile has been used), `nix profile install nixpkgs#git`, or add "git" to your configuration.nix
- eopkg: `sudo eopkg install git`

## 1.5. Switch to Git Bash (Windows Only)

- Close Terminal
- Reopen Terminal, select the arrow near the "+" icon, and select "Git bash" (enables `.sh` scripts on Windows)
