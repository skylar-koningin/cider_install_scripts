# DISCLAIMER

This is not a free way to use Cider â€” you must already have a license to use it.

For Cider devs and legal: I am not sharing a way to use Cider for free and I recognize that Cider is owned by you wonderful people. I am making this mainly for myself because I like to distrohop and I want a quick way to install it. The only reason I'm uploading it to GitHub is because I feel that some people would also find it useful.

# How to Install and Use

## 0. Download the binaries from https://taproom.cider.sh

Linux users using apt, dnf, pacman, or zypper can skip this step, but it's recommended not to reduce the chance of errors.

### Explanation for this step:

Stated by Elijah (creator of Cider) in the Discord server responding to me posting my repo there: "We generally don't recommend re-distributing Cider binaries on GitHub, as Cider is a paid product this could lead to unintended interpretation if people don't read into it all the way ... people combing Google can easily skip this information if SEO decided to bump entries." I then asked if I should remove the binaries, and he said, "I'd recommend so, you can let people supply them themselves or wait until we provide public ones at some point."

Please don't send Elijah or Cider devs any hate, and I can completely understand their reasoning.

## 1. Install Git and Ruby

- Windows: `winget install Git.Git RubyInstaller.Ruby`
- MacOS: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" && brew install git ruby`
- apt: `sudo apt install git ruby`
- dnf: `sudo dnf install git ruby`
- eopkg: `sudo eopkg install git ruby`
- nix: `nix-env -i git ruby` (wont work if nix profile has been used), `nix profile install nixpkgs#git nixpkgs#ruby`, or add "git" and "ruby" to your configuration.nix
- pacman: `sudo pacman -S git ruby`
- zypper: `sudo zypper install git ruby`

## 1.5. Switch to Git Bash (Windows Only)

- Close Terminal
- Reopen Terminal, select the arrow near the "+" icon, and select "Git bash" (enables `.sh` scripts on Windows)

## 3. Enter the Repository
